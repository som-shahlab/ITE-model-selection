Although validation-set prediction error is used across the board to select between predictive models, there is no consensus on how to perform model selection for individual treatment effects models. However, general-purpose approaches have been proposed. We describe each of these approaches and demonstrate how many of them work by minimizing a loss between the treatment effect function estimated on the training set and applied on the validation set and a treatment effect directly estimated on the validation set. The validation set estimate serves as a plug-in for the true individual treatment effect of each individual in the validation set. We establish some conditions on the validation set estimator that ensure statistically sound model selection. We also explain methods that are based on optimizing decision value and demonstrate a connection between them and the treatment effect loss-based methods.
