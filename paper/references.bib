BART is the only non-ensemble method that does really well in terms of RMSE. It also has reasonable coverage, which is improved with TMLE. CV-bart helps a little, but default is totally fine.

BART wins heterogenous effects more or less by default (no other good methods submitted, e.g. causal forest or causal boosting).

BART is also nearly the fastest.

Estimand: sample ATT

DGPs:
- No unobserved confounding
- Overlap
- Treatment and outcome simulated with GAMs
- Covariates taken from a single study
- Binary treatment and continuous outcome

Knobs in simulations:
- nonlinearity
- % treated
- overlap
- "alignment" ({\#} of confounders)
- heterogeneity
- effect magnitude}
