HCTZ should still be used as part of a drug cocktail in standard low-dose form, but it is not recommended in monotherapy vis-a-vis alternatives.}

BART is the only non-ensemble method that does really well in terms of RMSE. It also has reasonable coverage, which is improved with TMLE. CV-bart helps a little, but default is totally fine.

BART wins heterogenous effects more or less by default (no other good methods submitted, e.g. causal forest or causal boosting).

BART is also nearly the fastest.

In our simulation study, data mining techniques tended to yield higher C for the EPS models than LR, except for RP with pruning. SEs of the effect estimates were greater in models with high C, since an EPS model with high C creates less overlap in propensity scores and therefore results in a smaller size of the matched dataset.}

One review suggested observational studies had larger effects of interest, and two reviews suggested observational studies had smaller effects of interest.Similar to the effect across all included reviews, effects from reviews comparing RCTs with cohort studies had a pooled ROR of 1.04 (95% CI 0.89 to 1.21), with substantial heterogeneity (I2 = 68%). Three reviews compared effects of RCTs and case-control designs (pooled ROR: 1.11 (95% CI 0.91 to 1.35)).No significant difference in point estimates across heterogeneity, pharmacological intervention, or propensity score adjustment subgroups were noted. No reviews had compared RCTs with observational studies that used two of the most common causal inference methods, instrumental variables and marginal structural models.}

The variables in our model failed to account for a large proportion of the variability in cost. This would suggest that future analyses exploring differential procedure costs between hospitals must look for factors beyond patient baseline characteristics and postoperative outcomes.

NOTE: We pulled the data for all isolated mitral valve procedures (International Classification of Diseases, ninth revision, clinical codes 35.12, 35.23, and 35.24) during the period from 2005 to 2008, including the charges associated with each hospitalization. Patients were excluded if they were less than 30 years of age, had coronary revascularization, congenital heart disease, excision of ventricular aneurysm, replacement of thoracic aorta, aortic fenestration procedure, closed heart valvuloplasty, heart transplant, or other valvular repair or replacement.}

The inclusion of these variables will increase the precision of the estimated exposure effect without increasing bias. In contrast, including variables that are related to the exposure but not the outcome will decrease the precision of the estimated exposure effect without decreasing bias. In small studies, the inclusion of variables that are strongly related to the exposure but only weakly related to the outcome can be detrimental to an estimate in a mean-squared error sense. The addition of these variables removes only a small amount of bias but can strongly decrease the precision of the estimated exposure effect.


{\^A}~This result also suggests that there is little risk in adding a variable unrelated to exposure to a PS model. If the included covariate is unrelated to the outcome, it will affect neither the bias nor the variance of the estimator, but if it is related to the outcome, it can improve efficiency.}

The literature suggests MV-Repair may have improved 30-day mortality and long-term survival. All 12 studies identified, however, were non-randomised, retrospective, and at significant risk of bias due to heterogeneous surgical techniques and mismatched patient characteristics. Data describing the need for reoperation were not sufficiently well reported to analyse. Functional outcomes and health-related quality of life were not reported. In conclusion, high-quality randomised comparison of MV-Repair and MV-Replacement is urgently needed.

Feature engineering: 
- use everything
- leverage repeated measurements (e.g. by using counts and/or time bins) and justify the approach
- impute missing labs if reasonable, and justify the approach
- use visits themselves as features! (one thought I've had is to cross visit counts with comorbidity indices to get a rough indicator for health-independent utilization, perhaps a proxy for socioeconomic status)

Models:
- use ML approaches and let the model select your variables

Validation and Reporting:
- cross-validate and also use a test set
- report PPV
- assess calibration
- validate at a different site (e.g. use OHDSI)}
